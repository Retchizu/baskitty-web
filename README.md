# Baskitty Web

This is a simple web application designed to display the status of an email verification process. The primary purpose of the site is to notify users whether their email has been successfully verified or if there were issues such as expired or invalid tokens.

When a user clicks the email verification link sent from the system, the site will show a success or failure message, along with any relevant details (e.g., token expiration, invalid link).

Features:
Email Verification Status: The site dynamically checks if the email verification was successful or if an error occurred (e.g., expired token).
About Page: A page that explains the purpose of the site and provides some information about the service.
Privacy Policy Page: A page that outlines how user data is collected and used.
